                <p class="text text4" >Helloo!! I'm Lyanz Jerome L. Navarette. I'm a self-taught front-end and back-end developer that loves making designs 
                    that are both useful and engaging. For me, coding is a combination of logic and creativity, and 
                    I like creating projects that challenge my knowledge. In addition to my passion for development, 
                    I am an expert photographer who uses each image to tell a story and capture distinctive viewpoints. 
                    Beyond stills, dynamic scenarios and angles that give images life are what really 
                    pique my interest in cinematography. You may also frequently find me with my guitar, performing and creating music 
                    that reflects my creative spirit, when I'm not in front of the camera or buried in code. 
                    My identity is defined by these hobbies, which also motivate me to study and create every day.</p>

                <h3>Opalyn</h3>
                <p>This is my mother. She is from Lubao, Pampanga and a sweet and loving mother. She is a stay at home mom
                  that take care of us all and is my motivation to keep on pursuing my dreams to be able to give back
                  everything she did for us. She is an amazing mother and I wouldn't exchange her for anyone.

                <h3>Aries</h3>
                <p>This is my father. He sacrif iced half of his life working in abroad to be able to give us a proper
                  education. He is now a work from home call center agent. He is an admirable father and his dedication and
                  love for our family is the reason I am the man I am today.

                <h3>Kurt</h3>
                <p>This is my brother, 2nd eldest with me being the eldest of us 4 siblings. He is also a Computer Science student.
                  Like me he is also fond in photography and using the guitar. He is also intelligent and 
                  one of top in his class. He is my other half in my family.

                <h3>Kirsten</h3>
                <p>This is my little sister. She is the 2nd youngest and the only girl in our family. Which makes her our
                  little princess. She is a smart and beautiful young lady. I admire her for her constant perseverance at school
                  despite not being able to go to a private school, she still strives and is the top 1 in her class.
                </p>

                <h3>Liam</h3>
                <p>This is our youngest sibling. He is the most spoiled and stubborn kid among us. He is also smart and is also top 
                  in his class. I admire him for having so much talent in doing anything without the help of anyone. Which reminds
                  me so much of myself. He is talented in multiple ways and is also intelligent, at young ages he taught himself to play
                  the drums and piano by himself while watching youtube.
